This repo contains all work for our final project.

Please note that due to the in-depth nature of our project, the notebook takes about 30-45 minutes to run on a normal laptop. In turn, we have a notebook prerun all ready to view - final.ipynb.

Our report is also in this repo as a .pdf file (ML_Systems_Write-Up.pdf).

We hope you enjoy!
